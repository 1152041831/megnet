These are updated models are trained on the 2019.4.1 Materials Project crystals data set. The data is available at [https://figshare.com/articles/Graphs_of_Materials_Project_20190401/8097992](https://figshare.com/articles/Graphs_of_Materials_Project_20190401/8097992).

## Performance

| Property | Units      | MAE   | Data size |
|----------|------------|-------|-----------|
| Ef       | eV/atom    | 0.026 | 133,420   |

The model is trained with a train:validation:test ratios of 0.8:0.1:0.1. The 
MAE errors for train, validation and test are 7.2, 24.4, and 25.5 meV/atom, 
respectively.
